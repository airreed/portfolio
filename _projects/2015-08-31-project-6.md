# Unity3D
To implement the Twig walking GAIT I used [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=CNngyI300scCFYI7gQodzBYMlQ), for the following reasons:

1. Can be used in both Windows and MAC
2. It produce games for all the most popular platforms and cellphones
3. You can have free personal use
4. It supports C#, making most of developer tools from Microsoft available
5. It has a big and active community

## Step 1: Getting a Ragdoll
A Twig kinematic character is composed by rigid rods connected to each other by nodes as shown in the figure bellow.

![Twig_Character]()

The Unity3D analogy for that would be the 3D ragdoll, a  character represented by rigid bodies fully affected by physics, connected by configurable joints. In principle, any 3D humanoid rigged character can be transformed in a ragdoll through the Ragdoll Wizard (see the video bellow). 
**PS:** It is recommended that the rigged body is saved in a "T" like position.

## Step 2: Configuring Colliders and Ragdoll Joints
The Ragdoll Wizard does a very good job for you in setting the raw ragdoll, although by own experience if you want your character to be working properly and avoid having to redo work I strongly encourage you to spend some time doing a more detailed tuning on your character. 

### 2.1: Colliders
The Unity physics engine uses the [colliders boxes](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BoxCollider.html) to calculate collisions and you can use them in your scripts to trigger events. By default the Ragdoll Wizard usually makes the colliders way bigger than what you really need (see raw the colliders in gree on the figure bellow), what makes the ragdoll to move in a clumsy and sometime even unexpected ways. For my character I made sure they were almost overlapping with  the real size of each respective rigid body.

### 2.2: Joints
Once again Unity does not do everything automatically for us. The ragdoll uses the [Character Joint](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CharacterJoint.html) component that gives you three preconfigured axis of rotations. Make sure to put the orange gizmos as the axis of rotations for places that do not rotate back like knees and elbows (see figure _), this is only axis you can five different values for maximum and minimum rotation, while the others axis will rotate the same amount of degrees for both sides (if you configure with 40 it will rotate from -40 to +40). Finally, make sure each joint is rotating as much as you will need on each axis, usually the arms are the ones that need to be paid more attention. In the figure bellow I show an example of how the joints in the arm should be set.

### 2.2: Add the Foot Rigid Body
By default the Ragdoll wizard do not add a [rigid body](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html) for the foot. In my implementation of Twig the forces that move the leg are added in the foot, the upper leg controller only function is too lock undesired rotations so the character do not move in undesired ways. Therefore, I added a rigid body for the each foot and attached it to its respective leg through a [Character Joint](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CharacterJoint.html). 

## Step 3: The State Machine
The main difference of my approach of Twig in comparison to the one proposed by Professor Horswill is the use of a state machine to coordinate each actuator in the characters body. The most challenging part of this project, main cause of bugs and misbehaves is fact that so many controllers works simultaneously to keep the GAIT compliant. In my opinion, using a state machine to manage things like when should each controller do its function and the ragdoll rotations to coordinate the parts of the body to face the proper directions, makes implementing and debugging it way easier. 

The diagram below shows schematized the state transitioning:

## Step 4: Making the Ragdoll Stand
Making the ragdoll stand was perhaps the most important step, since it needs to stand stable enough so it does not make the walking GAIT weird and too hard to implement. For this purpose a PID controller calculates the force necessary to maintain the body in a reference point. This controller is added in both the hips and head of the doll and maintains the center of mass of the respective body in a 3D reference (X, Y, Z) where Y is the height from the floor and X and Z is the midpoint of the feet in the XZ-plane (see the figure below).

![Mid Point]()

One of the advantages of this implementation is that the ragdoll can easily crouch by reducing the referential value of Y. This controller was implemented in the script *StandSwat*.  
 
Configuring the gains of the controller was challenging, as I said before getting a stable position was crucial for the walking, after I got a raw tuning  of the proportional gain the process shown in the video bellow was used to get a good damping and integral constants.

In the video the constants are almost tuned still with some damping and integral needing to be added. In addition, to standing this script is also responsible for rotating the body according to the referential given by the state machine.
